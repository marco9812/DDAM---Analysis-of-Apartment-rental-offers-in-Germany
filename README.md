# DDAM---Analysis-of-Apartment-rental-offers-in-Germany
This project focuses on the distributed analysis and mining of a real-world dataset related to rental properties in Germany.
We leveraged Apache Spark to handle large-scale data processing and applied various data mining and machine learning techniques to extract insights and build predictive models.

🔍 **Project Goals**
1) Analyze rental data in Germany to understand key patterns and relationships.

2) Use distributed computing to efficiently process and explore the dataset.

3) Apply machine learning and clustering techniques to support data-driven decisions. 

📊 **Main Activities**
**1) Data Pre-processing**

- Data cleaning and normalization

- Handling missing values

- Feature engineering

- Encoding categorical features

**2) Machine Learning**

- Classification: predicting categories (e.g., price range)

- Regression: estimating rental prices based on property features

- Model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE, Accuracy, and F1-score

**3) Clustering**

- Unsupervised segmentation of the rental market

- KMeans clustering and interpretation of the resulting groups
